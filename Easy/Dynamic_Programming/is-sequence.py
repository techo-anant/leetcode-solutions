# Question

# Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

# A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
# Output: true
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
# Output: false
 

# Constraints:

# 0 <= s.length <= 100
# 0 <= t.length <= 104
# s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
 

# Follow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s1, s2, ..., sk where k >= 109, and you want to check one by one to see if t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

# Solution Time: O(m*n), Space: O(n*m)

class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        # optimal solution can be reached using two pointers approach

        m, n = len(s), len(t)

        dp = [[False]*(n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]

        for i in range(n+1):
            dp[0][i] = True

        for i in range(1, m+1):
            for j in range(1, n+1):
                if s[i-1] == t[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]
        

        return dp[m][n]
